- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cathanys
- 🏬 I have been working for Thorlabs GmbH as a software developer for 13 years.
- 📇 With the programming languages C ++ / C # I create Windows desktop programs to control the measuring devices and to display the measurement results graphically.
In addition, we supply customers with a library for each device in C, with converters and examples in DotNet, LabView and Python.
The firmware of some devices is also programmed by me under C.
- 👀 In my private life I organize tournaments for various esport games. 
The tournaments are announced on our website, players can see their performance from previous tournaments and generate an invitation link to the Faceit matchmaking platform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js
- 📫 The best way to concact me is per messages on Twitter @Cathanys
